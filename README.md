## Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### The Server <a name="server"></a>

FileServer consist of a multithreaded server that listens for incoming clients on the main thread and processes the client request on a separate pool 
of threads. This helps the server from not being occupied by the processing of the long running client request. And server will always be available 
for listening to new client request. Once the server process the client request, the server will generate a response and send it to the client.

and handles each client request on a separate thread.


### The Client <a name="client"></a>

The client sends a request to the server. And waits for the server response. After the server sends back a response the client displays an approriate message realated to the response to the user. 

The client can send the different types of request to the server, which are as following:

1. The client can send a request to upload a file on the servre.
2. Client can also fetch a file from the server.
3. Delete a file from the server.
4. Client can also close its connection to the server.
5. It can also send a request to shutdown server (In real world scenarios we don't do this :P)
